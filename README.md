# Setup Google Analytics using Google Tag Manager

In this tutorial, we will learn how to add Google Analytics to a WordPress website through Google Tag Manager. Previously, we used to add Google Analytics code directly to a WordPress websiteâ€™s header section. Now, we will handle all the functionality of Google Analytics using the Google Tag Manager code. This will enable us to manage all tracking with a single code. Additionally, Google Tag Manager allows admin users to customize the tracking settings and publish from its dashboard very easily. In the following steps, we will learn more about the settings.

## Get the GTM code

1. Log in to the Google Tag Manager site.

4. Next, click on the `Google Tag` link.

5. Paste the `Measurement ID` in the `Tag ID` field. Click the `Save` button.

6. Next, set up the `Triggering` section. Click on the pencil icon.

7. Click on the `All Pages` check box. Next, Click `Add` button and `Save` the settings.

8. The setup is done.

## Test and publish the task

1. Although, the setup is done, we need to test and publish the task. We will complete them in the following steps.

2. For the test, Select the `Tag` and click on the `Preview` button.

3. We have to add our website name in the popup window.

4. For improving the debugging experience, we can install `Tag Assistant Companion` Browser Extension for Google Chrome. However, it is optional.

5. If everything is set up correctly, you will see a summary like the following screenshot.

6. Now, go back to the `Google Analytics`site and click on the `Data display` link. Click on the Debug View Link.

7. The debug view link will show you the result, like the following screenshot.

8. Now, everything looks fine. So, we can publish the settings from the `Google Tag Manager`. Select the Tag checkbox and click on the Submit button.

9. Note that it is a good practice to create/update tags by the version number or date. Here is an example.

10. You can also see the update from the dashboard.
